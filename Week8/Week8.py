Object-Oriented Programming

- There are different paradigms of programming. As you learn other languages, you will start recognizing patterns like these.
- Up until this point, you have worked procedurally step-by-step.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a compelling solution to programming-related problems.
- To begin, type code student.py in the terminal window and code as follows:
"""
    name = input("Name: ")
    house = input("House: ")
    print(f"{name} from {house}")
"""
