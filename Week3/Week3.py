Exceptions
Exceptions are things that go wrong within our coding.
In our text editor, type code hello.py to create a new file. Type as follows (with the intentional errors included):

print("hello, world)
Notice that we intentionally left out a quotation mark.

Running python hello.py in our terminal window, an error is outputted. The compiler states that it is a “syntax error.”” Syntax errors are those that require you to double-check that you typed in your code correction.

You can learn more in Python’s documentation of Errors and Exceptions.
